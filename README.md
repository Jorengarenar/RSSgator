Some time ago I had an idea for self-hosted RSS service รก la Google Reader, but never done anything more than playing with [GNU Libmicrohttpd](https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd) tutorial.

Nowadays we already have solutions like [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org), [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org) or [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app), which may not be exactly how I'd like it, but are close enough for now.

This repository serves as a kind of TODO for me, would I in the future want to come up with my own solution.  
Ergo: project postponed infefinitely.
